    the curated dining-out experience has disappeared during the pandemic. hot becomes cold, and crispy becomes soggy, thanks to delivery and takeout. 
    a forum topic about dental appliances causing taste changes evokes a similar sentiment to this. 
    though these two situations are uncontrollable and inevitable as individuals, 
    allowing the user to create their own poem of the experience is a way to give power back to the individual, in a therapeutic and fun manner.

       in the 90's and early 2000's there existed many virtual spaces you could visit as
       if they were libraries, clubhouses, or meeting places. individuals took
       pride in the html customization they would undertake to create a certain aesthetic for their
       virtual space, and the website would be moulded to fit their desired usage. this is in 
       contrast to today's sites like facebook and instagram that provide a concrete aesthetic and function
       to users that sign up for accounts.
      with covid impacting outings outside the home, virtual spaces have become even more important in connecting people 
      and providing places to explore.     <br><br><a href="file:///Users/hwa-jinjun/Documents/GitHub/buttontree/index.html">this project aims to investigate</a> the abstraction of food and their spaces we visit
      to eat them
      in the time of quarantine. no longer do we visit a curated physical space, with foodstuffs prepared just right. rather, we are left with take-out and delivery,
      where noodles are clumped, meat is just warm, and crunchy parts have become limp — the dishes have
      become a shadow of what they are meant to actually be. the image of food we cannot make ourselves has become
      an inaccessible ideal, competing with what we have experienced pre-covid and perfect pictures we view online.
      here, curated forum posts on topics about changes in taste are displayed to expand and collapse relative to their 
      opening post. upon the click of a button, black body text is toggled off to display selected words that make 
      disjoined poetry about the topic at hand. large, interactive pixelated foods modelled off of notable things personally
      eaten pre-covid are placed atop all of this, only somewhat looking like the foods they are meant to be. blocking the type from being read, the abstracted food
       must be moved around by the user such that they may choose to display or hide certain aspects of the expanded trees to create their
       own narrative and poetry. <b>in this way, the fun and curated experience of going out to eat delicious food
        is returned to the user, transforming the odd food experiences into fun ones.</b>

        we rely on our trust of the media and people around us to provide information from outside our personal spheres, 
        but this inevitably brings in distortion of facts; plato's allegory poignantly explains this phenomenon.
         we only know for certain what we experience with our senses, and rely on others outside our personal spheres
          to provide us information on the experiences they live. the distortion of 3d object to 2d shadow is 
          inevitable, and likewise, so too is the 
        distortion of experiences we do not personally live. similarly, the curated choices a creator makes in 
        communicating a story to us all weave the resulting perception we gain of a situation. without 
        a personal, lived experience, there will always be that distorted perception. seeing for ourselves the 
        lived lives of people outside of our comfort zones, talking to those whose lives differ from ours,
         and curiously questioning the world around us are methods to combat this. 
        to acknowledge that we rely on the translation of events, means that we acknowledge our own
        ignorance.

        <i>this isn't the whole picture</i> attempts to explore this concept by using a month's worth of 
        daily photo-sequence capture. the new york city (ny, usa) skyline is reconstructed using masks of buildings
        and skies from a variety of time and day to manipulate the viewer's perception of the time of day and weather
        taking place. the loud, bustling never-sleeping city of new york is intentionally transformed into a quiet, 
        and still landscape that hides the ever-constant traffic and fast pace of its people.
        overlapping video and audio of 
        mundane household tasks reinforce this image of new york city. 
        over the course of the video, these clips transform into disturbing visuals like
        body obsessive scratching. in tandem, a personal transcription of the silent film, metropolis (1927)

        the every-day-carry comprises of essentials you bring along wherever you go. with the pandemic of '20-'21 requiring
        at-home isolation,
         it has seen little to no use.
         whilst isolating at home for the past year 
        i have realized that i still use a sort of edc whose contents have have transformed with the circumstances:
         tylenol for head pains, 
         a fragrance burner and its accompanying candle to teleport me outside of my bubble,
        noise cancelling headphones to silence the noise of a bustling house, and finally, a 
        lip balm for my constantly-chapped lips.
        these objects have been translated into 2d forms that, once printed out, can be assembled
        into paper models, so that one may live a day in quarantine as i do. 
        with their artifact-riddled textures, simplified geometry, and the inevitable mistakes of
         assembly, the resulting paper models vaguely resemble their original form - 
        as if data has been lost through a game of broken telephone.
        in the same vein, covid-19 has changed our daily lives to become a ghost of what it once was.
         the pandemic has become a lens in which
        our daily lives are refracted and warped. in its distortion of items from 3d to 2d, back to 3d, the composition aims to
        demonstrate this experience; that even when we attempt to recreate our typical lives within isolated bubbles, they are only poor
        imitations of what we previously experienced or truly wish to live.

        graphite lines and scans of ink jet type were processed in photoshop

        revolution's contribution to architecture, i wanted to
        focus on re-bar for its incredible role in advancing architectural ability. 
        having the typographic elements 'swirl' around this central imagery visually 
        reinforces the idea that the industrial revolutions advancement of architecture
        was directly due to this invention.<br><br>

        because <h style="color:transparent;">poster 2</h> was for a post-modernist lecture, i knew i wanted to create a loud
        and bustling poster. organic, undulating waves with depth were used as a background
        as post-modernist arts and architecture enjoyed liberal use of curves and asymmetry. 
        a scanner was used to further introduce curve and distortion into some type elements,
        since another trend of post-modernism included the rejection of 'pure' form. though loud,
        underlays of white/black were used to increase legibility of text atop a noise-riddled texture.
